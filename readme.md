### Summary:

This Python script simulates a conversation between four AI chatbots—GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Ollama—using different predefined personalities. Each chatbot has its own behavior: GPT is argumentative, Claude is polite, Gemini is logical, and Ollama is universally liked. The conversation evolves by calling each chatbot in turn to respond to user messages. The system employs OpenAI's GPT, Google’s Gemini, and a simulated Ollama chatbot, with responses generated through each AI's specific system prompt.

### Code Explanation:

1.  **System Prompts for Each Chatbot**:
    Each chatbot has a unique personality defined by a system prompt, influencing how they respond to user messages:

    -   **`gpt_system`**: Defines GPT as argumentative and snarky, challenging everything in the conversation.
    -   **`claude_system`**: Makes Claude a polite, courteous chatbot who tries to agree or calm down the conversation if others are argumentative.
    -   **`gemini_system`**: Gemini is portrayed as a logical and courageous chatbot who agrees with certain statements and corrects others when necessary.
    -   **`ollama_system`**: Ollama is depicted as universally liked, with their statements making sense to everyone, responding positively to all chat participants (GPT, Claude, and Gemini).
2.  **User Messages**:
    These are the initial messages for each chatbot. They set up the conversation and represent the starting point for each participant:

    -   `gpt_user_msg`: The message from GPT.
    -   `claude_user_msg`: The message from Claude.
    -   `gemini_user_msg`: The message from Gemini.
3.  **Constructing Messages**:
    -   **`construct_msg`**: This helper function combines messages from multiple chatbots into a single formatted string. The function takes two messages at a time (e.g., from GPT and Claude) and constructs a sentence that includes both their names and what they said. This string is then sent to the relevant AI.

    ```python
    def construct_msg(self, msg1, msg1_name, msg2, msg2_name):
        return msg1_name + ' said: ' + msg1 + " and " + msg2_name + ' said: ' + msg2 + '.'
    ```

    Example output: `"GPT said: Hello There and CLAUDE said: Hi, okay."`

4.  **Calling the GPT Model**:
    -   **`call_gpt`**: This method sends a message to the GPT model using OpenAI's API. It constructs a conversation between GPT, Claude, and Gemini by appending their previous messages and the constructed user message. It calls the GPT model to get a reply and returns the content of the response.

    ```python
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model= gpt_model,
        messages= messages
    )
    ```

    Here, `gpt_model` represents the model used (e.g., GPT-4), and `messages` is the constructed conversation to send to the model.

5.  **Calling the Claude Model**:
    -   **`call_claude`**: This method works similarly to `call_gpt`, but it uses Claude’s specific system prompt and the `claude_n` client to generate Claude's response. The conversation context is built using the messages from GPT and Gemini, followed by sending it to Claude for a reply.

    ```python
    response = claude_n.messages.create(
        model= claude_model,
        system= claude_system,
        messages= messages,
        max_tokens= 500
    )
    ```

    `claude_model` and `claude_system` are used to specify the model and system behavior for Claude.

6.  **Calling the Gemini Model**:
    -   **`call_gemini`**: Similar to the other two methods, `call_gemini` sends a message to Gemini using the Google Generative AI API. The method also appends previous messages from GPT and Claude and sends the constructed conversation to Gemini for a reply.

    ```python
    response = google.generativeai.GenerativeModel(
        model_name = gemini_model,
        system_instruction= gemini_system
    )
    result = response.generate_content(messages)
    ```

    `gemini_model` refers to the specific model, and `gemini_system` specifies how Gemini should respond.

7.  **Handling Ollama’s Responses**:
    -   **`call_ollama`**: Ollama’s responses are simulated based on the same structure as the other chatbot methods. The script uses a placeholder `ollama.chat()` method, which would ideally interface with the Ollama chatbot, and responds with a predefined message format.

    ```python
    response = ollama.chat(model=ollama_model, messages=messages)
    return response['message']['content']
    ```

8.  **Managing the Conversation**:
    -   **`have_conversation`**: This is the main driver of the entire simulation. It prints the initial messages from each AI and then enters a loop (5 rounds in this case) where it sequentially calls each chatbot (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Ollama), retrieves their responses, and appends them to the respective message list for the next round.

    ```python
    for i in range(5):
        gpt_next = self.call_gpt()
        print(f"{gpt_name}:\n{gpt_next}\n\n\n")
        gpt_user_msg.append(gpt_next)

        claude_next = self.call_claude()
        print(f"{claude_name}:\n{claude_next}\n\n\n")
        claude_user_msg.append(claude_next)

        gemini_next = self.call_gemini()
        print(f"{gemini_name}:\n{gemini_next}\n\n\n")
        gemini_user_msg.append(gemini_next)
    ```

    Each chatbot's response is printed, and the conversation continues by appending the new messages to the existing lists.

### Conclusion:

This Python script is an interactive chatbot simulation where four different AI personalities—GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Ollama—engage in a conversation. The script utilizes OpenAI's GPT API, Google's Gemini API, and a simulated Ollama chatbot to generate responses based on their unique system prompts. The `Conversation` class manages the conversation flow and interactions between the chatbots. Each round of conversation involves calling the corresponding AI models to generate the next set of responses, and the conversation continues for five rounds.
